Like *Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood*, this book is from my grandma. *Song of Solomon* is my favorite book I have read this year - I laughed, I cried, I felt nostalgic for a place and time I've never existed in. I recommend this powerful novel to anyone. “You wanna fly, you got to give up the shit that weighs you down.”
