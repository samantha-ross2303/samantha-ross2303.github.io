This is my third time reading this book. I read it first in Spanish - "Como Agua Para Chocolate" - in my high school AP Spanish class. I've read this copy once before, but I love it so much I read it again. There's not many books I choose to re-read. My mom was gifted this copy for her 24th birthday by her best friend Jasmin, then she gave it to me. See the sweet note below...
