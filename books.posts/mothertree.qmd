Professor Iris Holzer recommended we (the students of her soil science class) see Suzanne Simard speak at Cambell Hall. She is a forestry scientist, who has done groundbreaking research on forest ecology and plant intelligence. I found her talk to be so inspiring that I bought her book. The Mother Tree Project is something I'd like to get involved in.
